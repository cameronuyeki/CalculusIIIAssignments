# Calculus III Assignments

<h2>Description</h2>
This repository consists of past midterms taken in my Calculus III course done in RStudio. Throughout this semester course, main assignments/midterms covered basic calculus problems. To help visualize written calculus problems more easily, some of the questions include plots, tables, and graphs of surface, contour, heart-shaped, and heat diffusion plots implemented by intro RStudio programming to aim at better overall understanding and the ability to analyze the given data. 
These assignments encapsulate the courseload for this class over the course of the semester.
